## Having issues with your VPROJECT environment variable?
Please ensure that a User environment variable is set with the name "VPROJECT". Tsukuru expects a User environment variable, instead of a System environment variable.

The VPROJECT user env variable must be set to the game directory. 

For example: G:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf
